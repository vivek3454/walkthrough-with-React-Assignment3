# React Image Gallery Mini Project

This mini project involves creating an image gallery using React. The gallery will fetch a set of images from a given API, limit the results to 20 images, and display them in a user-friendly UI. Additionally, users will be able to click on any photo to be redirected to a single image view, where they can view additional information such as the title and description of the image.
